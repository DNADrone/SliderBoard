# SliderBoard
I am trying to create a procedurally generated HUD-like board with sliders and buttons which the user can modify in the editor in any way he/she wishes. The board will be made from a single C++ class and would contain all the functionality for the end-user to customize it as necessary.

This project is an attempt for me to learn C++ coding in Unreal Engine. I made a very similar sliderBoard when I was learning blueprint scripting in Unreal Engine.

Please feel free to clone this repository and use it in any way required.

Thanks,
